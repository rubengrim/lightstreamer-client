/// Interface to be implemented to listen to Subscription events comprehending notifications
/// of subscription/unsubscription, updates, errors and others.
///
/// Events for these listeners are dispatched by a different thread than the one that generates them.
/// This means that, upon reception of an event, it is possible that the internal state of the client
/// has changed. On the other hand, all the notifications for a single LightstreamerClient,
/// including notifications to ClientListener, SubscriptionListener and ClientMessageListener
/// will be dispatched by the same thread.
pub trait SubscriptionListener: Send {
    /// Event handler that is called by Lightstreamer each time a request to clear the snapshot
    /// pertaining to an item in the Subscription has been received from the Server.
    /// More precisely, this kind of request can occur in two cases:
    ///
    /// - For an item delivered in COMMAND mode, to notify that the state of the item becomes empty;
    ///   this is equivalent to receiving an update carrying a DELETE command once for each key
    ///   that is currently active.
    ///
    /// - For an item delivered in DISTINCT mode, to notify that all the previous updates received
    ///   for the item should be considered as obsolete; hence, if the listener were showing a list
    ///   of recent updates for the item, it should clear the list in order to keep a coherent view.
    ///
    /// Note that, if the involved Subscription has a two-level behavior enabled
    /// (see `Subscription::set_command_second_level_fields()` and
    /// `Subscription::set_command_second_level_field_schema()`), the notification refers to the
    /// first-level item (which is in COMMAND mode). This kind of notification is not possible
    /// for second-level items (which are in MERGE mode).
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///

    ///   "Item Group" then a `None` value is supplied.
